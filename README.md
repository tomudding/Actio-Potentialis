# Actio Potentialis
'Actio Potentialis' is a small and simple artificial neural network written in C++ for Vibrowtion.

### About
Actio Potentialis (from the Latin ag≈ç and the Late Latin potentialis) is sort of a wordplay on the premise of the '[Vibrowtion](https://github.com/tomudding/Vibrowtion)' project and the actual physiological process that allows neurons to communicate in (artificial) neural networks.

### Acknowledgements
The code used for Actio Potentialis is predominantly based on the code of [George Chousos](https://github.com/GiorgosXou). A huge thanks to them for making this project a lot easier.
